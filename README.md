# RPG Bros

An RPG knowledge base to share. This document is a guide for making your own content, and is not (and should not be) published.

## Publishing

> **WARNING.** Documents in `working` will be visible to other contributors.

> **DANGER!** Periodically, `working` will be published to `master`. Anything inside `/pages/` and `/static/` will be immediately published TO THE INTERNET once it is in the master branch.

### Discord (player)
All players and contributors should have access to the [discord](https://discord.gg/NUJeG5S). We use it to run games online, plan, chat etc. If you want to make an article, but don't feel like you need writer or admin privileges, you can submit a document to the "submissions" channel in the discord and it will be reviewed and added manually.

### Forestry (writer)
Forestry is a web app for writing web content without any code. If you have no technical experience but want to add web pages more frequently, ask for "writer" privileges to get an invite.

### Github (admin)
Any tech savvy contributers may wish to have access to the Github repo. This will let you use your own text editor, propose changes, submit issues, make add new layouts, and even request or create your own features. If you would like to help me expand the site, or if you just want to use your own text editor, ask for "admin" privileges.
