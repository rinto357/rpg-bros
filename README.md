# RPG Bros

An RPG knowledge base to share. This document is a guide for making your own content, and is not (and should not be) published.

## Publishing

> **WARNING.** All documents in the "pages" folder will be immediately published to the "working" branch, which can be viewed by other contributers.

> **DANGER!** Anything published to the master branch will be immediately published LIVE TO THE INTERNET.

### Discord (player)
All players and contributors should have access to the [discord](https://discord.gg/NUJeG5S). We use it to run games online, plan, chat etc. If you want to make an article, but don't feel like you need writer or admin privileges, you can submit a document to the "submissions" channel in the discord and it will be added manually.

### Forestry (writer)
Forestry is a web app for writing web content without any code. If you have no technical experience but want to add a web page, ask for "writer" privileges to get an invite.

### Github (admin)
Any tech savy contributers may wish to have access to the Github repo. This will let you use your own text editor, propose changes, submit issues, make feature requests, and even program your own features. If you would like to help me expand the site, or if you just want to use your own text editor, ask for "admin" privileges.
