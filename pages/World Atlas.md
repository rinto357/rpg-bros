# The Map of Eruca
![[Eruca.png]]
## Distance and Travel
Above is a map of Eruca, the region of the [[Prime Material Plane]] in which the game takes place. Each square of the map is roughly 200 miles. At a forced march (8 hours a day at a fast pace) it takes roughly a fortnight (14 days) to reach [[Othrondo Nimloth]] from [[Than'zodar]] by foot. The distance traveled is slightly longer by sea, but allows for 100% up-time on traveling. With a good crew and fair winds, the same journey can be completed in just under a week.

Travel near the edges of the main continent is mostly inhibited by large mountain ranges, while the central regions are primarily dominated by the two great river systems acting as continental divides.

Most cities are spaced roughly a square away from their nearest cities, except on the west coast where cities are roughly 2 squares apart. A week per square is a good rule of thumb. You can half this time for players with special means of travel (sea, flight, etc.) or double the travel time to account for difficult terrain (such as mountains, forests, or large rivers).
